# How To Talk To Anyone

## What the book is about

> "The lost art of verbal communication may be revitalized by Leil Lowndes."

> "You'll not only break the ice, you'll melt it away with your new skills."

This book discusses different techniques for approaching any situation, from the less formal to the more formal, providing tricks for **communicating better** and understanding people.

### What i learned 

There are many techniques explained in the book, 101 to be precise. The one I enjoyed the most is the one called "__eyeball selling__", which is a technique for selling a product to a person, the technique consists of observing the customer's expressions and body language to understand if what we are talking about interests him, if not, you can continue to divert the subject until it pleases him, and then once approval is obtained sell the product.

There are others tricks that I have appreciated and that have been useful to me at work (at the moment I do not work as a programmer), an example is the one called "__comm-YOU-nication__" which consists of starting a sentence with the word You, to get the listener's attention, this will tease and interest him, making him feel taken in, useful both in the case of needing favours, and in the case of compliments.

Finally, other techniques, e.g. the "__Never the naked__" family of techniques, indicate that when we talk about ourselves, e.g. about our work or other facts to explain what it is about and not to take anything for granted, as well as to avoid dead moments in the conversation.

## Would I recommend it?

Yes, for anyone. Especially those who have to communicate efficiently for work, but not only from a business point of view, but for every kind of person who wants to be comfortable in every situation and to move in the best possible way.
Although some techniques seem a bit manipulative to me (nothing against, it depends on how they are used), it is always useful to be aware of how certain politicians or businessmen behave, as well as to increase one's **social skills**.
