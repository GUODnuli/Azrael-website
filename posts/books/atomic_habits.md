# 活着

诚实地说, 这是我自高中毕业以来, 重新开始阅读的第一本书. 为什么选择这本书开始呢? 其实只是因为余华这位作者是我女友的偶像, 同时这本书是余华名气最大的一本书. 当时我正在选择当月阅读书籍, 正巧在书城路过了这本书, 于是开启了我阅读余华书籍的路程.

## 这本书在说什么

The book draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide to making good habits (even very difficult habits) inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories of Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving doctors, and stellar comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and leap to the top of their field.

### What i learned 

First of all, it made me realize certain bad habits of mine and see the world from a different perspective, especially social networks and their impact on our lives, making me reevaluate the society we live in and how we are influenced.

I had some favorite phrases, which in my opinion can sum up the content of this text.

> Success is the product of daily habits-not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.

This quote emphasizes that success is the sum of many small changes, not a breakthrough that happened only once.

Another quote I really appreciated is this one.

> The [Goldilocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks_principle) Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.

So don't start with things that are **too hard**, but get there gradually, it may sound trivial but it is not at all for example it happened to me, to read books that were too hard for my experience and habit, or projects that were too complicated.

I would like to conclude with a key concept in this book, the simpler something is and gives us "satisfaction," the more damaging it is, while the more complicated it is, the more it will give us results and fulfillment.

## Would I recommend it?

Yes, definitely especially for new developers who are not yet in the habit of programming and anyone who wants to pursue a goal as it **is not about motivation but about habits**.
