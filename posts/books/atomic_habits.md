# Atomic Habits

First of all I would like to say that this is one of the first books of this kind that I have read, usually programmers do not read this kind of book, it is more of an economist and business man thing, but instead I have been able to get a lot out of it and I think every developer should start reading mindset and personal growth books.

## What the book is about

The book draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide to making good habits (even very difficult habits) inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories of Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving doctors, and stellar comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and leap to the top of their field.

### What i learned 

First of all, it made me realize certain bad habits of mine and see the world from a different perspective, especially social networks and their impact on our lives, making me reevaluate the society we live in and how we are influenced.

I had some favorite phrases, which in my opinion can sum up the content of this text.

> Success is the product of daily habits-not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.

This quote emphasizes that success is the sum of many small changes, not a breakthrough that happened only once.

Another quote I really appreciated is this one.

> The [Goldilocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks_principle) Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.

So don't start with things that are **too hard**, but get there gradually, it may sound trivial but it is not at all for example it happened to me, to read books that were too hard for my experience and habit, or projects that were too complicated.

I would like to conclude with a key concept in this book, the simpler something is and gives us "satisfaction," the more damaging it is, while the more complicated it is, the more it will give us results and fulfillment.

## Would I recommend it?

Yes, definitely especially for new developers who are not yet in the habit of programming and anyone who wants to pursue a goal as it **is not about motivation but about habits**.
